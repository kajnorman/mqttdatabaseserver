installed like 

	sudo apt-get update
#	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install sqlite3


Make a new directory called "data":

mkdir data
cd data
We need the sql database to store the key, value and current time. 
So the database will have a table that contains three fields

First, create the database:

sqlite3 data.db
This will create a database in the file data.db. We should now be in a sqlite shell, so type:



#Modified downto here.. the rest needs adapting

CREATE TABLE climate (reading_time datetime, temperature float, humidity float);
Now we’ve created a table called climate, we can add to that table. Let’s test it by adding a random date, time, humidity and temperature:

INSERT INTO climate (reading_time, temperature, humidity) values (“2011-06-21 12:34:56”, 20, 77);
You can view the contents of the table,

SELECT * FROM climate;
And you can clear the table,

DELETE FROM climate;
Perfect! So we have a database on the raspberry pi, and we have created a table in to which we will store data.
