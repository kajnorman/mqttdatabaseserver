Freely quoted from the above article  by knn :


To install sqlite3 and learn a bit more about it, check this link, https://iotbytes.wordpress.com/sqlite-db-on-raspberry-pi/

EXample 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
Make a new directory called “reading”:

mkdir reading
cd reading
We need the sql database to store the temperature and humidity, as well as the current time. So the database will have a table that contains three fields – the date, the temperature, and humidity.

First, create the database:

sqlite3 data.db
This will create a database in the file data.db. We should now be in a sqlite shell, so type:

CREATE TABLE climate (reading_time datetime, temperature float, humidity float);
Now we’ve created a table called climate, we can add to that table. Let’s test it by adding a random date, time, humidity and temperature:

INSERT INTO climate (reading_time, temperature, humidity) values (“2011-06-21 12:34:56”, 20, 77);
You can view the contents of the table,

SELECT * FROM climate;
And you can clear the table,

DELETE FROM climate;
Perfect! So we have a database on the raspberry pi, and we have created a table in to which we will store data.
